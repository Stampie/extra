the requirement should be updated to ``~0.10`` as we will depend on the new tag anyway, not on 0.7 (0.7 will never contain the new interface)

you need to implement the interface in ImpersonateMessage, not only adding the method of the interface in the class. Otherwise it won't work.

@stof Sure, because of this https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Stampie/blob/master/lib/Stampie/Mailer/Mandrill.php#L78-L80 :)

@Ninir Please put this logic in the Decorator base class instead (it is part of building a message decorator, not specific to impersonating)
